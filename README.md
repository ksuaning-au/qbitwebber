# qbitwebber

A minimalist, mobile-friendly frontend for qbittorrent web UI.

I built the initial version of this on a weekend because I felt the other options were a bit cluttered.

Built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Features

- Manage Torrents
- RSS Feed
- Search
- Settings (Simplified Compared to Offical Web UI)
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Demo Mode

Run without a backend for demonstration purposes:

```bash
npm run demo
npm run demo:build
```

## Release Build

```bash
npm run release
```

## Disclamer

I built this on a weekend because I felt the other options were a bit cluttered. It is likely missing things. I may or maynot maintain this.
